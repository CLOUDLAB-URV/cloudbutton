<p>Dr. Gil Vernik (IBM Research Haifa) gave a talk at the <b>Strata Data Conference 2019</b> that took place from 23rd to 26th of September in New York. Put on by Cloudera and O'Reilly, Strata Data focuses on using big data to gain business advantage. The event includes tutorials, training sessions, keynotes, ... so it is an excellent opportunity to see how people are using big data to solve real problems in the real world.</p> 

<p>Gil Vernik's talk, entitled <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny/public/schedule/detail/77226">"Your easy move to serverless computing and radically simplified data processing"</a>, presented <a href="https://github.com/pywren/pywren-ibm-cloud">Cloud Button Toolkit</a>, a framework that is being developed as part of the CloudButton project. Gil took a deep dive into the challenge of how serverless computing can be easily used for a broad range of scenarios, like high-performance computing (HPC), Monte Carlo simulations, and data preprocessing for AI.</p>
