<p>We are happy to announce that the work of the <a href="https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/">LSDS group</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> on <b>Faasm</b>, a high-density stateful serverless runtime based on WebAssembly, was accepted at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20">USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC 2020)</a>. ATC will take place on July 15â€“17, 2020, in Boston, MA, USA, and is one of the most prestigious systems venues. Kudos to Simon Shillaker and Peter Pietzuch!</p>

<p>
Faasm is a high-performance stateful serverless runtime. The goal of the project is enabling fast, efficient serverless big data.
</p>

<p>Faasm provides multi-tenant isolation, but also lets functions share regions of memory. These shared memory regions give low-latency concurrent access to data, supporting high-performance distributed serverless applications.</p>

<p>By running WebAssembly, Faasm combines software fault isolation with standard OS tooling to provide security and resource isolation guarantees at low cost. Functions run side-by-side as threads of a single runtime process, with low overheads and fast boot times.
