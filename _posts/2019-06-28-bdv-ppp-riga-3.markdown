<p>The CloudButton project has attended the <a href="https://www.big-data-value.eu/ppp-summit-2019/" target="_blank">BDV PPP Summit</a> that was held from 26th to 28th June 2019 at the Latvian National Library in Riga.</p>

<p><strong>About the event</strong></p>

<p>The first day of the BDV PPP Summit 2019 was open to everybody and called the BDV PPP Conference, followed by two days of workshops and the BDV PPP Meetup. Activity Groups, Technical and Steering Committees, as well as the BDVA General Assembly, were on the programme. Keynotes combined with panels and a lot of networking opportunities were an ideal chance for network building and for making the projects known to a broader audience.</p>
