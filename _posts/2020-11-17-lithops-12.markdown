title: Release of the Lithops framework
author: CloudButton project

---
<p>CloudButton released one of the main software outcomes of the project: the <a href="http://lithops.cloud/">Lithops framework</a>. Lithops aims to massively scale the execution of Python code and its dependencies on serverless computing platforms and to monitor the results. Lithops delivers the userâ€™s code into the serverless platform without requiring knowledge of how functions are invoked and run.</p> 

<p>The framework provides an extensible backend architecture (compute, storage) that is designed to work with different Cloud providers and on-premise backends (Knative, OpenWhisk). You can edit programs using Lithops in a laptop and then run the unmodified code at scale in the cloud using any cloud provider (IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Aliyun).</p>
